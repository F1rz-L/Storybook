# [EX] Coffee Stains & Late Nights

*(content is AI generated)*

---

The campus café was nearly empty, save for the hum of machines and the smell of burnt espresso. **Lena** sat hunched over her laptop, her screen glowing with half-finished essays and red scribbles. She rubbed her eyes, willing herself to stay awake.

Across the room, **Daniel** — the boy from her history lecture — was sketching equations on a napkin, his coffee untouched. He glanced up, noticed her frustration, and after a hesitant pause, walked over.  

*“You look like you’re fighting your computer,”* he said, half-grinning.  

Lena sighed. *“I am. And it’s winning.”*  

He laughed, pulling out the chair beside her without asking. *“Mind if I join the war effort?”*  

To her surprise, his presence was easy, unforced. He leaned over her screen, pointing out details she’d missed, suggesting ideas she hadn’t considered. His voice was calm, steady, and it made the chaos in her head quiet down.  

Hours slipped by. Their empty cups gathered between them, stained with the marks of late-night caffeine. Every time their hands brushed — reaching for a pen, passing a notebook — she felt the flicker of something warm, something dangerous.  

At last, Lena hit “save” and closed her laptop with a sigh of relief. *“Done.”*  

Daniel leaned back, stretching. *“Told you it wasn’t unbeatable.”* Then, almost shyly, he added:  

> “Besides, I like late nights better when you’re here.”  

Her heart stuttered. She bit her lip, unsure if it was the caffeine or him making her pulse race. Gathering courage, she slid one of the empty cups toward him, her handwriting scrawled across the side: *“Next coffee’s on me?”*  

Daniel smiled, the kind of smile that promised more than coffee. And in the quiet of the café, beneath buzzing lights and forgotten deadlines, something new began — a love story written not in ink, but in coffee stains and midnight laughter.
